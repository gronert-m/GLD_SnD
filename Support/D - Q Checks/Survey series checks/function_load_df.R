#' Load country's latest GLD harmonizations
#' 
#' This function loads the latest GLD harmonizations for a country
#'
#' @param path_in The string (quoted) path to the folder containing all surveys
#'   of country X. 
#' @param wap_only Binary operator deciding whether the harmonizations read in
#'   shall keep all ages or only WAP. If TRUE (default) data is reduced to WAP,
#'   if FALSE, all ages are kept.
#' @param vars_to_study String vector of variables (or single string of variable)
#'   to be kept and later looked ate. All other variables (other than countrycode, 
#'   year, vermast, veralt, age, weight, unitwage, whours, and wage_no_compen) 
#'   are dropped if no vars to study are requested (default is NULL)
