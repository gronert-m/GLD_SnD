#' Make wage time-series 
#' 
#' This function creates a DF with wage distribution over time from GLD surveys.
#'
#' @param df The data frame to be used (a GLD harmonized dataset)
#' @param wage_emp Binary indicator of whether the data should be
#'   reduced only to the wage-employed (default is TRUE)
#' @param drop_zeroes Binary indicator of whether the data should 
#'   drop cases when wage or whours are 0 (default is TRUE)
#' @param group String variable name for additional grouping variable.
#'   Default is to not add any (NULL).
#' @param country The ISO alpha 3 country code we are looking at.
