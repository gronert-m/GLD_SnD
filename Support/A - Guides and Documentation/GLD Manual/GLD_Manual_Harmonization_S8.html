<h3>minlaborage<a class="headerlink" href="#minlaborage" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is the lowest age for which the labor module is implemented in the survey or the minimum working age in the country. For this reason, the lower age cutoff at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>

<section id="lstatus">
<h4>lstatus<a class="headerlink" href="#lstatus" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>lstatus is an individual’s labor status in the last 7 days. The Value must be missing for individuals less than the required age (minlaborage).</p>
<p>Three categories are used after harmonization:</p>
<p>1 = Employed</p>
<p>2 = Unemployed</p>
<p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p>
<p>All persons are considered active in the labor force if they presently have a job (formal or informal, i.e., employed) or do not have a job but are actively seeking work (i.e., unemployed).</p>
<p>1 = Employed</p>
<p>Employed is defined as anyone who worked during the last 7 days or reference week, regardless of whether the employment was formal or informal, paid or unpaid, for a minimum of 1 hour. Individuals who had a job, but for any reason did not work in the last 7 days are considered employed.</p>
<p>2 = Unemployed</p>
<p>A person is defined as unemployed if he or she is, presently not working but is actively seeking a job. The formal definition of unemployed usually includes being ‘able to accept a job.’ This last question was asked in a minority of surveys and is, thus, not incorporated in the present definition. A person presently not working but waiting for the start of a new job is considered unemployed.</p>
<p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p>
<p>A person is defined as not-in-labor force if he or she is, presently not working and it is not actively seeking a job during the last 7 days or reference week.</p>
</section>
<section id="potential-lf">
<h4>potential_lf<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-lf" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The ILO defines unemployment (as stated above) as seeking *and* available for a job. The potential labor force is formed by the “available potential job seekers”, who are available but not looking for a job and the “unavailable job seekers”, that is those looking but not available. The below image (<a class="reference external" href="https://ilostat.ilo.org/persons-outside-the-labor-force-how-inactive-are-they-really/">source here</a>) shows the different definitions.</p>
<p><br></br>
<img alt="Definition of potential labor force" src="../../../_images/vars_potential_lf.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>The variable potential_lf thus codifies whether the person is not in the labor force over the past 7 days (lstatus=3, missing otherwise) but could potentially be they are i) available but not searching or ii) searching but not immediately available to work. The codes are:</p>
<p>0 = No (not potentially in the labor force)</p>
<p>1 = Yes</p>
</section>
<section id="underemployment">
<h4>underemployment<a class="headerlink" href="#underemployment" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Codifies whether the person is in the labor force and working over the past 7 days (lstatus=1, missing otherwise) but would take on more jobs or more hours at their job if possible/available. The codes are:</p>
<p>0 = No (not underemployed)</p>
<p>1 = Yes</p>
</section>
<section id="nlfreason">
<h4>nlfreason<a class="headerlink" href="#nlfreason" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>nlfreason is the reason an individual was not in the labor force in the last 7 days. This variable is constructed for all those who are not presently employed and are not looking for work (lstatus=3) and missing otherwise.</p>
<p>Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<p>1= Student (a person currently studying.)</p>
<p>2= Housekeeper (a person who takes care of the house, older people, or children)</p>
<p>3= Retired</p>
<p>4 = Disabled (a person who cannot work due to physical conditions)</p>
<p>5 = Other (a person does not work for any other reason)</p>
<p>Fill this information for all people interviewed in the labor section of the questionnaire regardless of their age.</p>
</section>
<section id="unempldur-l">
<h4>unempldur_l<a class="headerlink" href="#unempldur-l" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>unempldur_l is a continuous variable specifying the duration of unemployment in months (lower bracket).</p>
<p>The variable is constructed for all unemployed persons (lstatus=2, otherwise missing). If it is specified as continuous in the survey, it records the numbers of months in unemployment. If the variable is categorical it records the lower boundary of the bracket.</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed for everyone who is not unemployed. Other missing values are also allowed.</p>
</section>
<section id="unempldur-u">
<h4>unempldur_u<a class="headerlink" href="#unempldur-u" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>unempldur_u is a continuous variable specifying the duration of unemployment in months (upper bracket).</p>
<p>The variable is constructed for all unemployed persons (lstatus=2, otherwise missing). If it is specified as continuous in the survey, it records the numbers of months in unemployment. If the variable is categorical it records the upper boundary of the bracket. If the right bracket is open a missing value should be inputted.</p>
<p>Missing values are allowed for everyone who is not unemployed. Other missing values are also allowed. If the duration of unemployment is not reported as a range, but as continuous variables, the unempldur_l and unempldur_u variables will have the same value. If the high range is open-ended the unempldur_u variable will be missing.</p>

<section id="empstat">
<h4>empstat<a class="headerlink" href="#empstat" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>empstat is a categorical variable that specifies the main employment status in the last 7 days of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in Employment with some revisions to take into account the data available.</p>
<p>Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as ‘non-paid employee’</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>An employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as self-employed.</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and where one has not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services, in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>
<p>Other, workers not classifiable by status include those for whom insufficient relevant information is available and/or who cannot be included in any of the above categories.</p>
</section>
<section id="ocusec">
<h4>ocusec<a class="headerlink" href="#ocusec" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>ocusec is a categorical variable that specifies the sector of activity in the last 7 days. It classifies the main job’s sector of activity of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire.</p>
<p>Four categories after harmonization:</p>
<p>1 = Public sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces)</p>
<p>2 = Private, NGO</p>
<p>3 = State-owned</p>
<p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p>
<p>1 = Public Sector, Central Government, Army (including armed forces) Public sector</p>
<p>The part of economy run by the government.</p>
<p>2 = Private, NGO</p>
<p>Private sector is that part of the economy which is both run for private profit and is not controlled by the state, it also includes non-governmental organizations</p>
<p>3 = State-owned enterprises</p>
<p>State-owned includes para-state firms and all others in which the government has control (participation over 50%).</p>
<p>4 = Public or State-owned, but cannot distinguish</p>
<p>Select this option is the questionnaire does not ask for State-owned enterprises, and only for Public sector.</p>
<p>Additionally, recall the fact that, in common English usage, a public company (often denoted as public limited company or PLC) are private companies in the private sector but whose ownership is organized via stocks tradeable in a <em>public</em> market, i.e., accessible to all, not run by the public sector.</p>
<p>The following is an example of the relevant question in the 2010 Pakistani LFS:
<br></br>
<img alt="Questionnaire example ocusec pitfalls" src="../../../_images/vars_ocusec.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>Here code 4 represents a public enterprise (explicitly mentioned as a corporation created by a legislative body) and code 6 a public limited company (a private sector company whose shares can be bought by the general public). <strong>Code 6 should not be considered part of the public sector</strong>.</p>
<p>Coding would then be (assuming the original question is called var_sector):</p>

<section id="industry-orig">
<h4>industry_orig<a class="headerlink" href="#industry-orig" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>industry_orig is a string variable that specifies the original industry codes in the last 7 days for the main job provided in the survey (the actual question) and should correspond to whatever is in the original file with no recoding. It will contain missing values for people below the working age. Other missing values are allowed. It classifies the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise</p>
</section>
<section id="industrycat-isic">
<h4>industrycat_isic<a class="headerlink" href="#industrycat-isic" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Code (string variable) of the industry according to the International Standard Industry Classification (ISIC) in the last 7 days for the main job of any individual with a job (lstatus=1) and is missing otherwise. Note that the preamble to the harmonization code should record what version of ISIC is being used.</p>
<p>The code should always be as long as the longest depth available for the ISIC version. For example, the latest version at the time of writing (ISIC Rev 4, <a class="reference external" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/census/documents/isic_rev4.pdf">available here</a>) codes industries by sections, divisions, groups, and classes, in decreasing order of hierarchy.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the classification structure for the manufacture of machinery and equipment. The letter C codes the Manufacturing <em>section</em>, while the code 28 represents “Manufacture of machines and equipment n.e.c” <em>division</em>. This division has two <em>groups</em> (281 and 282), containing one and three <em>classes</em> respectively.</p>
<p><br></br>
<em>Figure 1 - Example of ISIC classification</em>
<img alt="Example of ISIC classification" src="../../../_images/vars_industrycat_isic_1.png" />
<br></br></p>
<p>A single section will often cover several divisions. While D has only one division (35 – electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply) and could be potentially shortened to “3”, section C covers divisions 10 to 33.</p>
<p>If the information in the survey is only present at section level (or can only be translated from the national industry classification to section level) this variable should be a string with the letter coding the correct section.</p>
<p>In most cases, information will be coded as a set of digits. In this case, the codification should be a string of four digits with a zero padding before for division 1 through 9 (i.e., 01, to 09).</p>
<p>As an example, Figure 2, puts together a few excerpts from ISIC Rev.4. Note that, if we do not codify correctly, group 14 (Animal production) may be misunderstood for division 14 (Manufacture of wearing apparel).</p>
<p>If we only have information up to the group label, fill out the reminder of the digits with zeros. Hence the purple box in Figure 2 would be coded as “0140”. The red box, as we have all digits, including the zero padding at the start codes as “0142”.</p>
<p>The act of adding zeroes to the end is standard if the lower level hierarchy has no further distinctions and can be seen in the yellow box, where group 142 has no classes (or just one class) and thus is coded as “1420”.</p>
<p>Some groups do in fact have several classes, as can be seen for group 151. Again, if we only had information up to group level, we ought to code “1510”. If we have more detailed information, for example identifying the industry as “Tanning and dressing of leather; dressing and dyeing of fur” (green box) we would code “1511”.</p>

Note that the preamble to the harmonization code should record what version of ISCO is being used.</p>
<p>The code should always be as long as the longest depth available for the ISCO) version. For example, the latest version at the time of writing (ISCO-08, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm">available here</a>) codes occupations by Major, Sub-major, Minor, and Unit groups, in decreasing order of hierarchy.</p>
<p>ISCO code Major groups cover a single digit, running from 1 (Managers) to 9 (Elementary Occupations) with the additional category 0 (Armed Forces Occupations). Hence there is only need for zero-padding on the left side for Armed Forces Occupations. Figure 3 shows an example of the possible values that can be taken on.</p>

<p>If we only had information at Major Group level, a person working as a Services and Sales Worker ought to be coded as the number 5000. If the information is at Sub-major Group level, it should be codified as the number 5100 for a Personal Services Worker, while a Travel Attendant, a Conductor, or a Guide (if information at Minor Group level) should be coded as the number 5110.</p>

The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in</p>

<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as non-paid employee.</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>Employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and ‘contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as own account.</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs are those where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and have not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>

<p>lstatus_year is an individual’s labor status in the last 12 months. The Value must be missing for individuals less than the required age (minlaborage).</p>
<p>Three categories are used after harmonization:</p>
<p>1 = Employed</p>
<p>2 = Unemployed</p>
<p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p>
<p>All persons are considered active in the labor force if they presently have a job (formal or informal, i.e., employed) or do not have a job but are actively seeking work (i.e., unemployed).</p>
<p>1 = Employed</p>
<p>Employed is defined as anyone who worked during the last 12 months or reference week, regardless of whether the employment was formal or informal, paid or unpaid, for a minimum of 1 hour. Individuals who had a job, but for any reason did not work in the last 7 days are considered employed.</p>
<p>2 = Unemployed</p>
<p>A person is defined as unemployed if he or she is, presently not working but is actively seeking a job. The formal definition of unemployed usually includes being ‘able to accept a job.’ This last question was asked in a minority of surveys and is, thus, not incorporated in the present definition. A person presently not working but waiting for the start of a new job is considered unemployed.</p>
<p>3 = Not-in-labor force</p>

<p>empstat is a categorical variable that specifies the main employment status in the last 12 months of any individual with a job (lstatus_year =1) and is missing otherwise. The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in</p>
<p>Employment with some revisions to take into account the data available. Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as ‘non-paid employee’</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>An employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as self-employed.</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and where one has not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services, in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>

The wage should come from the main job, in other words, the job that the person dedicated most time in the 12 months preceding the survey. This excludes tips, bonuses, other compensation such as dwellings or clothes, and other payments. The variable is constructed for all persons administered this module in each questionnaire. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For all those with self-employment or owners of own businesses, this should be net revenues (net of all costs EXCEPT for tax payments) or the amount of salary taken from the business. Due to the almost complete lack of information on taxes, the wage from main job is NOT net of taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>By definition, non-paid employees (empstat_year=2) should have wage=0.</p></li>
<li><p>The reference period of the wage_no_compen_year will be recorded in the unitwage_year variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use gross wages when available and net wages only when gross wages are not available. This is done to make it easy to compare earnings in formal and informal sectors.</p></li>

The variable is constructed for all individuals. For this reason, the lower age cutoff (and perhaps upper age cutoff) at which information is collected will vary from country to country.</p>
<p>The definitions are taken from the International Labor Organization’s Classification of Status in</p>
<p>Employment with some revisions to take into account the data available. Five categories after harmonization:</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>
<p>1 = Paid Employee</p>
<p>Paid employee includes anyone whose basic remuneration is not directly dependent on the revenue of the unit they work for, typically remunerated by wages and salaries but may be paid for piece work or in-kind. The ‘continuous’ criteria used in the ILO definition is not used here as data are often absent and due to country specificity.</p>
<p>2 = Non-Paid Employee</p>
<p>Non-paid employee includes contributing family workers who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same households who cannot be regarded as a partner because of their degree of commitment to the operation of the establishment, in terms of working time or other factors, is not at a level comparable to that of the head of the establishment. All apprentices should be mapped as non-paid employee.</p>
<p>3 = Employer</p>
<p>Employer is a business owner (whether alone or in partnership) with employees. If the only people working in the business are the owner and ‘contributing family workers, the person is not considered an employer (as has no employees) and is, instead classified as own account.</p>
<p>4 = Self-employed</p>
<p>Own account or self-employment includes jobs are those where remuneration is directly dependent from the goods and service produced (where home consumption is considered to be part of the profits) and have not engaged any permanent employees to work for them on a continuous basis during the reference period.</p>
<p>Members of producers’ cooperatives are workers who hold a self-employment job in a cooperative producing goods and services in which each member takes part on an equal footing with other members in determining the organization of production, sales and/or other work of the establishment, the investments and the distribution of the proceeds of the establishment amongst the members.</p>
<p>5 = Other, workers not classifiable by status</p>

<h4>linc_nc<a class="headerlink" href="#linc-nc" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>linc_nc is a continuous variable that specifies the total annualized wage income in all the jobs including primary, secondary and others regardless of their period of reference. This excludes tips, bonuses, other compensation such as dwellings or clothes, and other payments.</p>
<p>Note: Use gross wages when available and net wages only when gross wages are not available. This is done to make it easy to compare earnings in formal and informal sectors.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned and Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#lessons-learned-and-challenges" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>For any variable not collected in a country, the variable should be created and left as missing (.) in the final harmonized file.</p>
<p>Variables in the data files must follow the sequence in which they appear in the manual.</p>
<p>Labor status during last 12 months only reflects if the person has worked during last year or not, as the vast majority of the surveys do not provide enough information to distinguish those individuals that are unemployed from those that are out of the labor force.</p>
<p>Individuals working in cooperatives are considered as “paid employee” in the employment status</p>
<p>variable.</p>
<p>Several checks should be conducted to ensure that the data is harmonized correctly. lstatus should be an integer in the range [1,3].</p>
