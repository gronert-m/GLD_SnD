# Introduction to Indonesian labor force survey – Survei Angkatan Kerja Nasional (SAKERNAS)

## What is the IDN SAKERNAS?

The National Labor Force Survey (or Survei Angkatan Kerja Nasional, SAKERNAS ) is a household-based sample survey conducted by Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) – Statistics Indonesia. Starting from 1976, SAKERNAS was implemented firstly as a module of the National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) and then it was separated from SUSENAS and conducted quarterly since 1986. 

## What does the IDN SAKERNAS cover?

The IDN SAKERNAS mainly covers information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activitiesover the previous 7 days. In some most recent years (i.e. 2016-2019), SAKERNAS has become more detailed and covers indiciduals' health conditions and social security status. Years used for harmonization are from 1989 to 2019 except that 1995 was dropped as SAKERNAS was not conducted in that year. There are apparent growths in number and dimension of the variables included in each year's survey over years. The years and sample size of SAKERNAS harmonized for GLD are: 

| Year	| # of Households	| # of Individuals	|

| 2019  | N/A        | 782,789        |

Note that even though SAKERNAS is a household-based survey and it indeed has household-related variables in some years, not every year's raw dataset provides complete location identification information for unique household ID generation. Therefore, numbers of households are not available (N/A) in the form above for those years without household IDs.  

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata of SAKERNAS are not publicly available. The raw data we used were acquired by filling in a data request form and then shared by the World Bank Indonesia Team. 

## What is the sampling procedure?

SAKERNAS uses a two-stage cluster sampling method in general, which includes two steps: 1) selecting the main sampling unit – census blocks and 2) selecting the ultimate sampling unit – households within each main sampling unit. As the frequency of data collection and level of data representativeness have changed over time, the implementation of sample selection methods also changed. For example, year 2007 is a dividing line in that all years before 2007 can only produce representative estimates up to province level whereas all years after 2007 (in cluding 2007) have representativeness untill district level except for the August round of 2016. The exception of year 2016 is because of the reduction on its sample size, which was reduced from 200,000 households to 50,000 households. The knowledge product, *A Guide to Working with Indonesian Survey Data*,  written by the Poverty Global Practice of the World Bank Group outlines the sampling procedure as:
   
```
Probability Proportional to Size method (PPS) is used when selecting census block from Master Sampling Frame (MSF) which contains the list of primary sampling units (PSU or wilcah/wilayah pencacahan). Sampling frame for the annual Sakernas was
developed using the results of population census conducted previously before the respective Sakernas was conducted, while sampling frame for the quarterly Sakernas was obtained from the sampling frame of Susenas. For example, sampling frame for Sakernas 2003 was derived from the results of 2000 Population Census (SP2000), while sampling frame used in Sakernas 2011 was coming from Susenas 2011 sampling frame.

After census blocks were selected, a systematical random sampling method is then used to select households
within census block (16 households per census block before 2011 and 10 households per census block since 2011). To
describe more clearly about how the sampling is done in Sakernas, this chapter covers two specific examples, i.e. for
Sakernas 2007 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015.

In Sakernas 2007 to 2010, the Master Sampling Frame was developed using the results of 2006 Economic
Census. Sampling procedure was done by district/city and was separated between urban and rural areas. For each
district/city, there were two stages sampling method as follows:

1.First stage: From the MSF, n(h) census blocks were selected (h=1 for urban and h=0 for rural) using Probability
Proportional to Size (PPS) method.

2.Second stage: From each census block that had been selected in the first stage, 16 households were selected
using a systematic random sampling method.

In Sakernas 2011 to 2015, the Master Sampling Frame is developed using the results of 2010 Population Census
(SP2010), which has been updated every time before the survey will take place. Starting from 2011, the period in which
Sakernas began to be conducted quarterly, household samples are selected using three-stage withdrawal, with the
following steps:

1.First stage: From the MSF, 30,000 PSUs are selected for Susenas sampling frame by using the method of PPS.
These 30,000 PSUs are then randomly allocated evenly for each quarter of Susenas, i.e. 7,500 PSU for each
quarter. From 7,500 PSUs of Susenas Quarter I, 5,000 PSUs were systematically selected to be used for Sakernas
Quarter I (February), and will be used again for Sakernas Quarters II (May), III (August), and IV (November).

2.Second stage: From each PSU in the 5,000 selected PSUs, two census blocks were selected using PPS method,
proportional to number of households based on SP2010 results. These selected census blocks were then
randomly allocated for Susenas and Sakernas (1 census block for Susenas and 1 census block for Sakernas). The
selected census blocks for Sakernas were utilized for provincial estimates and divided into 4 sample packages,
each of which consists of 1,250 census blocks.

3.Third stage: From each census block selected in the second stage, 10 households were selected using
systematic random sampling.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official reports detail results by gender, sector (urban and rural etc.), province, and district(or kab). Province is the first administrative level at which data from 1989 to 2006 are representative whereas district is the second level at which data from 2007 to 2019 are representative.

Two things to be noted regarding geographic significance level:

1) Historical changes to administrative divisions:  South Africa has 9 provinces which are currently divided into 52 districts. The 52 districts are further categorized into two types --- 44 non-metropolitan and 8 large city areas called metros. In the survey, the way of grouping these metro and non-metro areas changes before and after 2014. See more details below in the *"*[Changes in sub-national level categorization](#Changes-in-sub-national-level-categorization)*"* section.

2)  The original categorization of sector varies across years. Principally, the QLFS uses "Urban formal", "Urban informal", "Tribal areas", and "Farms and mining areas". But in no documentation does it clarify the categories in terms of urban/rural classification. See more details including the decision rule for harmonization below in the *"*[Coding of sector](#Coding-of-sector)*"* section.

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Unique Household ID Generation

Sample sizes and expanded population (that is the total population estimated using the weights) are compared to the reported data in the publication "*Labour Market Dynamics in South Africa*" by the Statistics South Africa for all years. Reports can be found on DataFirst under "Reports" in the "DOCUMENTATION" section (i.e. 2019 quarter 1 can be found [here](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/764)). The expanded population estimated using raw data match exactly the numbers in reports of year 2010 to 2019 after rounding.

The table below shows raw and processed sample sizes, numbers of dropped observations, reported population, and estimated population using raw and processed data. For year 2008 and 2009, the estimates and reported numbers are fairly close, 49,562 versus 49,374 in 2008 and 50,224 versus 50,044 in thousands. "*Labour Market Dynamics in South Africa, 2020*" changed its content and structure and does not state total population. Therefore, the expanded population estimate in 2020 is not comparable.

The fourth column "\# Drops" shows the number of dropped observations in each year. All of these observations were dropped during household head assignment process. The original variable `PERSONNO` has its first digit as 1 if the respondent is a household head. But some households do not have any member whose `PERSONNO` starts with 1. This may be because that the head did not present, or he/she did not spend four nights or more in the household.

The decision rule we created to assign household heads in cases where heads are absent are as follows:

1.  assign the ***eldest male adult*** as the head;

2.  absent male members, assign the ***eldest female adult*** as the head;

3.  absent adult members, the household does not have any household head;

4.  if there are multiple same-age same-gender members in a given household, no head will be assigned;

5.  drop households that do not have heads;

6.  individuals who are assigned to be heads should be heads regardless of waves, meaning he or she is the head for all four quarters in a given year.

Consequently, the dropped observations shown in the table are all because there is no adult member or multiple same-age male (or female) members exist.

### Changes in sub-national level categorization

The original variable `metro_code` is used for the GLD variable `subnatid2` but the number of categories of this variable changes from 7 to 17 after 2014, meaning that it has 7 categories from 2008 to 2014 and 17 categories from 2015 to 2020.

South Africa has 6 metro cities before 2011 and the country added 2 metros, *Buffalo City (East London)* and *Mangaung (Bloemfontein)*, in 2011. But this change in administrative structure does not appear immediately in the QLFS. There is a 4-year lag. From 2008 to 2014, the 7 items on `metro_code` list are 6 metros plus 1 group which combining all other non-metro areas together. Since 2015, 6 metros expand to 8, and additionally, the single "non-metro" group is split into 9 according to the provinces those non-metros belong to.

### Definition of Labor Status and Labor Force Participation 

The original variable `Geo_type` in the QLFS is not an urban-or-rural binary variable. Moreover, it varies over years. As shown in the table below, from 2008 to 2015, `Geo_type` contains urban formal, urban informal, tribal areas, and rural formal. But since 2016, it has urban, traditional, and farm/mining areas.

We referred to the published statistics of urban population (% of total population) of South Africa from [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS?end=2020&locations=ZA&start=2007) to decide the way of sector's harmonization. The original categories are re-grouped in such way that each year's result match World Bank's statistics correspondingly as close as possible.

|**Year**|                     **Original geo-type code**                    | **Re-categorization**         |

### Coding of industry and occupation codes

The QLFS of all years codes industry based on the [Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Fifth Edition (SIC 5)](http://www.statssa.gov.za/additional_services/sic/contents.htm), which is based upon the third revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (ISIC Rev. 3) published in 1990.

Regarding occupational classification, all QLFS years code occupation based on [South African Standard Classification of Occupations published in 2003 (SASCO 2003)](http://www.statssa.gov.za/classifications/codelists/SASCO_2003.pdf), which is based on the United Nations' International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88). The details on the process of creating the correspondence between national and international classifications [are covered here in a separate document](/Support/B%20-%20Country%20Survey%20Details/ZAF/QLFS/Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md).

### Assembling annual data using QLFS and LMDSA

The difference between LMDSA and QLFS is that the former compiles data collected in all QLFSs, that is four individual data sets representing four quarters, in a given year. All variables and observations remain the same in LMDSA except that the variable of weight is divided by four in LMDSA.

All years except 2020 have both LMDSA and QLFS available on DataFirst, and therefore, we used LMDSA for harmonization because of its simplicity and QLFS for cross-checking purposes. For year 2020, the annual data set was assembled manually by appending four QLFS data sets and dividing `weight` by four.

Year 2012 and 2016 need special attention. Using LMDSA alone for these two years are not enough because they both lose information to some degree. LMDSA 2012 does not contain `Q19ATTE` which is necessary for generating the GLD variable `school`. The solution is to append QLFSs in 2012 and extract `Q19ATTE` and merge it into LMDSA 2012. Similarly, LMDSA 2016 do not have complete information on `Geo_type`. This variable can be obtained from QLFS 2016 and brought into LMDSA 2016 to get the intermidiate dta file.  

### Change in implementation

Note that the QLFS since 2020 has switched from in-person interview to telephonic questionnaires. Therefore, the data are highly unlikely to be comparable to QLFS in previous years due to this change in how the information is collected and recorded.
