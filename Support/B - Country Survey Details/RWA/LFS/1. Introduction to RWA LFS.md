# Introduction to Rwanda Labor Force Survey (RWA LFS)

## What is the RWA LFS?

The Rwanda LFS has been conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) of Rwanda since August 2016. Adopting the framework set by the 19th International Conference of Labor Statistics ("ICLS-19"), the questionnaire is aimed to gather information on household roster characteristics, education, employment, primary and secondary economic activities in the past week, previous employment, own-use production of goods and services, and household assets.  Before 2019, it was a bi-annual survey conducted on February and August of the same year to capture seasonal changes in agriculture. Since then, it was rolled out as a quarterly survey that included additional rounds for May and November. Despite these changes, the questionnaire was unchanged with the exception of the May 2020 round where an abridged version was used.

## What does the RWA LFS cover?

The Rwanda LFS is a labor force survey with information on demographic characteristics, education, and labor market activities over the past 7 days. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| Year | HH count | Individual count |
|---|---|---|
| 2017 |          17,938  |                      77,761  |
| 2018 |          17,861  |                      76,670  |
| 2019 |          19,325  |                      81,778  |
| 2020 |          16,718  |                      70,172  |
| 2021 |          17,085  |                      71,947  |


## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are accessible to the public and researchers have to detail their purposes of using data to the [Rwanda National Institute of Statistics (NIS)](https://microdata.statistics.gov.rw/index.php/catalog). 

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Rwanda LFS is designed as a stratified two-stage sampling survey. All 30 districts of Rwanda, subdivided into urban and rural constitute the strata. The primary sampling units were selected with probability proportional to size from enumeration areas laid out in the 2012 Census sampling frame. There were 16 households sampled in each enumeration area (EA), except when there are fewer than 16 households living in the EA. 

The Rwanda LFS uses a rotation sampling design that differs between the 2016-2018 and 2019-2021 rounds. In the 2016-18 rounds, the sample is split equally into four rotation groups where one group is replaced by a new one every round. Thus, on a round-to-round basis, 75% of the sample is retained. In the rounds starting February 2019, the design follows a 1-1-1 scheme such that each household in a sampling group is interviewed every other quarter three times prior to replacement.

## What is the significance level?

The harmonized datasets contain a weight variable that is meant to generate annual estimates at the district level. 

## Adjustments during the Covid-19 pandemic

The 2020 Rwanda LFS underwent modifications in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Phone interviews were conducted for the May and November 2020 rounds, which compose the same rotation groups. During the May 2020 round, only basic household information and labor status were collected through an abridged version of the survey. As a result, the Rwanda NIS suggests that full-year estimates should only be computed for the limited indicators available in the May round. 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Definition of concept of employment

Since the passing of the [resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization](https://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_230304/lang--en/index.htm) in 2013 at the 19th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) surveys are at risk of a series break due to the change in the concept of employment.

In short, the ICLS 19 resolution restricts employment to *work performed for others in exchange for pay or profit*, meaning that own consumption work (e.g., subsistence agriculture or building housing for oneself) are not counted as employment.

The GLD codes the harmonization’s `lstatus’ variable based on the concept used in the survey. This has been the case for all years in the Rwanda LFS. Nonetheless, it possible to alter the code so that it matches the previous definition. The precise details are covered in a [separate document here](Converting%20between%20ICLS%20Definitions.md)

### Household ID

The datasets received contain ID information. In the GLD project, we have created IDs to provide the best user experience based on geographic identifiers. The household ID is formed based on information on the primary sampling unit and household identifier. 

### Discrepancies between the questionnaire and variables in the raw datasets

While the Rwanda LFS questionnaire remains largely unchanged over time, there were certain instances when the raw datasets do not contain the universe of variables implied by the questionnaire. These missing variables are detailed [here](Missing%20variables.md).

### Deriving key employment variables

The Rwanda LFS reports contain detailed guidance on how to calculate key employment variables, including labor status, underemployment, potential labor force and earnings. This process is documented [here](Deriving%20employment%20variables.md).

### Minimum age for education and labor questions

Education and labor questions were asked only for respondents aged 14 and above. This differs from the Rwanda NIS reports, which reports employment indicators for individuals aged 16 and above. Rwanda labor laws require that only individuals can only begin employment at the age of 16 but permitted apprenticeships for those between 13 and 15 years old.  

### Employment: Industry Classification

The Rwanda LFS follows a customized version of the ISIC version 4 called CISIC (see [here](utilities/RWA_CISIC.pdf)). However, there were codes that cannot be found in both the CISIC and ISIC version 4. The closest digit available was used when coding ISIC correspondence. For example, industry code "5111" was mapped to "5110". 

### Employment: Occupation Classification

The Rwanda LFS follows a customized version of the ISCO 2008 called CISCO (see [here](utilities/RWA_CISCO.pdf)). However, there were codes that cannot be found in both the CISCO and ISCO 2008. The closest digit available was used when coding ISCO correspondence. For example, occupation code "2213" was mapped to "2200" since no valid ISCO code can be found for the 3-digit equivalent, "2210". 

### Wages

The wage variable in the GLD, `wage_no_compen`, utilizes all available information to estimate household income from primary employment, including earnings in cash, in-kind, and net business income. In cases where households are unable to provide an exact income figure, they are asked to select the income range that they believe their income falls within. Another issue in coding the wage variable is that the underlying variables used to construct wages vary over the years; thus, the harmonized variable is patchy. For example, in 2018, the data only includes income earned in cash for respondents aged 16 and above, and in 2019, no income data is available in the raw dataset. For further details on harmonizing `wage_no_compen`, refer to this [separate document](Deriving%20employment%20variables.md).
