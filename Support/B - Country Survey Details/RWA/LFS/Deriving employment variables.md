# Deriving employment variables

There are cases of variables that were not in the datasets despite being included in the questionnaire or having an estimate reported in NSO reports. It is not clear why these variables were omitted in the datasets. This limits the indicators that can be generated out of the harmonized datasets.

## Labor status

### Employment

The employed are composed of people who have any of the following characteristics:

- Engaged in wage employment for at least an hour in the past 7 days

- Ran a business but not in agriculture

## Wage

Earnings data vary across the datasets. In 2017 and 2020, earnings data are available for both wage earners (cash and in-kind) and self-employed. In 2018 and 2021, data is only avalable for wage earners but only cash earnings are available in the former. And in 2019, there are no earnings data available for any of the employed.

There are some complications in combining data when there different sources of income.
- When respondent received both earnings in cash and in kind and time frames vary, the time frame for cash is used and in-kind earnings are converted to whatever time frame is used to report cash earnings. For example, if an individual reports receiving cash earnings on a monthly basis and in-kind earnings on a daily basis, the in-kind earnings are imputed in months (i.e., daily in-kind earnings is multiplied by 22).
- When wage workers were not able to report a specific income value and instead, reported a range of values, a specific value determined by the Rwanda NIS is assigned to the reported range.
