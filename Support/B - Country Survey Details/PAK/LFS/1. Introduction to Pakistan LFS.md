# Introduction to Pakistan national Labor Force Survey (LFS)


## What is the PAK LFS?

The Pakistan Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Federal Bureau of Statistics of Pakistan (BPS) regularly since 1963. This survey was firstly undertaken on quarterly basis in 2005; and became representative at district urban/rural level in 2020. 


## What does the PAK LFS cover?

The PAK LFS mainly covers details information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days. Since 1999, LFS began to include information on households' immigration status, such as whether a given household has migrated or not. Years used for harmonization range from 1992 to 2020 discontinuously, 15 years in total. 

Years and sample size of LFS harmonized for GLD are: 

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	|

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata of LFS are publicly available on the official website of PBS through this [link](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/lfs-2010-2018-microdata). And accordingly, each year's report of 2007 to 2020 can be found through the [link here](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/all-reports-and-publications). 


## What is the sampling procedure?

LFS uses a two-stage cluster sampling method in general, which includes two steps: 1) selecting the primary sampling units (PSU), which are enumeration blocks in both urban and rural domains 2) selecting the secondary sampling units, which include listed households of sample PSUs. The first year of the GLD, 1992, is only nationally representative at urban/rural level; the last year of harmonization, 2020, is the only year that has district level of representativeness; and all years in between are representative at the rural/urban level of the province. 

More details of the sampling frame & procedure are included in each year's annual report. Here is an example of LFS 2020:
   
```
**Universe**: The universe for Labour Force Survey consists of all urban and rural areas of the four provinces of Pakistan and Islamabad excluding military restricted areas. The population of excluded areas constitutes about 1% of the total population.

A stratified two-stage sample design is adopted for the survey.

Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has developed its own sampling frame for both urban and rural domains. Each city/town is divided into enumeration blocks. Each enumeration block is comprised of 200 to 250 households on the average with well-defined boundaries and maps. The frame used in this survey was the most recent frame which is updated through Population and Housing Census 2017.

**Rural Domain**: Each administrative district in the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KP) is considered an independent stratum whereas in Balochistan, each administrative division constitutes a stratum.
Urban Domain: All administrative divisions in the four provinces, constitutes separate stratum.

**Selection of primary sampling units (PSUs)**
Enumeration blocks in both Urban and Rural domains are taken as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Sample PSUs from each ultimate stratum/sub-stratum are selected with probability proportional to size (PPS) method of sampling scheme. In both Urban and Rural domains, the number of households in an enumeration blocks considered as measure of size.

**Selection of secondary sampling units (SSUs)**
The listed households of sample PSUs are taken as Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). A specified number of households i.e. 12 from each urban sample PSU and 16 from rural sample PSU are selected with equal probability using systematic sampling technique with a random start.

## What is the geographic significance level?

The official reports detailed results by gender, sector (i.e. urban or rural), province. Province is the first administrative level at which data from 1989 to 2006 are representative whereas district is the second level at which data from 2007 to 2019 are representative. Variable `subnatid1_prev1` in the harmonized dataset shows how the provinces change throughout time. More details about historical changes to administrative divisions can be found in this separate [document](Geographic_Significance_Level.md).


## Other noteworthy aspects


### Unique Household ID Generation

Household IDs are not directly available in SAKERNAS regardless of year. Location identifiers such as province, district, sector (urban or rural) etc. can be used to generate household IDs. However, these location identifiers are not necessarily fully available in all survey years. We created household IDs using STATA codes provided by the *The Guide* for years that have the full list of location identifiers required.

![STATA_HHID_codes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84488698/163726938-8dfafff8-f195-442f-bef7-6f3a9f9843f9.png)

Household IDs were only created if 1) the given year has the full list of identifiers and 2) the number of households generated using this method matches the household sample size in *The Guide*. Because *The Guide* only provides a range of household sample size for several years in rounded number, it is possible that our self-created household number is not equal to the exact number of household in a specific year. The table below shows the availability of location identifiers in each year and if they have household ID.  

| **Year**	    | **Location Identifiers Available**	| **HHID created?** | 
| :-------:	 | :------------------------------: | :-----------: | 
| 1989       | province, district, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number, serial number of households| No | 
| 1990-1994  | province, district, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number, serial number of households| Yes|  
| 1996-2001  | province, district, sub-district, village, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number| Yes |  
| 2002       | province, district, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number | Yes|  
| 2003-2008  | province, district, sub-district, village, sector, sample code number, household sample sequential number| Yes |  
| 2009       | province, district, sector, household sample sequential number|No| 
| 2010-2019  | province, district, sector| No| 


### Definition of Labor Status and Labor Force Participation

From 1989 to 2019, the structure of SAKERNAS, especially the labor force module has changed greatly. Not only does the number of labor-related questions increase, but also the logic as well as the order of questions change. Although our definition of the GLD variable `lstatus` and `potential_lf` never change, still, we needed to find the most appropriate question or a set of questions in the suvey to define the two variables, which sometimes requires slight adaptation. In order to make sure that we understood the intention and the logic of the questions and made adaptations correctly, we used labor force participation rate in the report from [International Labour Organization (ILO) microdata library](https://www.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog) ([here](utilities/IDN_2015_LFS_AUG_Report.pdf) is an example of 2015) as a benchmark for years with adaptations. But only 2014-2017 has detailed employed population, unemployed population and non-labor force data from ILO. We also used [World Bank country indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.ZS?end=2020&locations=ID&start=2000) as a general reference. Here are some brief explanations. A more comprehensive explanation of the harmonization choices [is covered here in a separate document](Labor_Status_and_Labor_Force_Participation.md).    

All the harmonized years can be grouped into three categories: 

1) 1989-1999: the questionnaires of these years follow the same structure and have the same labor force module questions. Simply following the order of the questions can locate all the conditions needed to decide the employed, the unemployed, and non-labor force population. 
2) 2000-2016ï¼šthe labor force module has become more complete (and complex). Questions are more well-guided during this time period. The *Only for Working Household Members* block states clearly the requirements for people to answer this block, which is a clear clue to code employed people.
3) 2017-2019: the last three years have the most up-to-date questionnaire structure, which adds details like work environment and welfare. Yet, while the block on employment status question increases and expands, the previous order was discarded and guide becomes blurred. Following the logic of the questionnaire would not produce sound labor force participation rate. We slightly changed the way we coded `lstatus` so as to get close to the ILO estimates.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the age required for education and labor force modules changed between 2016 and 2017: 10 years old for years 1989-2016 whereas it is 5 for 2017-2019.        


### Coding of industry and occupation codes

Regarding industrial classification, 5 versions of Indonesian Standard Industrial Classification (KBLI) were involved from 1989 to 2019 â€“ KLUI1997, KBLI2000, KBLI2005, KBLI2009, and KBLI2015. They were based on different versions of ISIC and were used in different years of SAKERNAS. in the [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md) 

Although four versions of Indonesian Standard Occupational Codes (KBJI) were involved â€“ KBJI1982, KBJI2000, KBJI2002, KBJI2014, we only used KBJI1982 and KBJI2002 during our mappiong process. Some years of SAKERNAS provide three versions of KBJI in the raw datasets yet with differet degrees of specifications. For example, SAKERNAS 2011 has KBJI 1982 three digits, 2000 1 digit and 2002 1 digit. But KBJI1982 three digits is the version we used most since it carries more information on occupation. 

Details about industrial and occuaptional mappings are covered in this [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)
