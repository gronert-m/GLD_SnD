# Correspondences between national and international classifications

This document describes the methodology used to map information on occupation coded in the survey per the national classification schemes to the international ISIC and ISCO codes. Here is the table concluding the versions and mapping status of all four years. *NOIC-INDS* is the national industrial classification whereas *NOIC-OCCP* is the national occupational classification:

| **ETH Year**	| **NOIC-INDS version**	| **ISIC Version**| **NOIC-OCCP Version**| **ISCO Version**|**INDS Mapping Status**|**OCCP Mapping Status**|
| :-----------:	| :-------------------: | :--------------:|:--------------------:| :--------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|   
| 1999 | NOIC 1994 | ISIC Rev.3 *allegedly*| NOIC 1994 | ISCO 88| Unmapped | Mapped at two-digit w/ modifications |
| 2005 | NOIC unknown | ISIC Rev.3 | NOIC unknown | ISCO 88| Mapped at three-digit w/ modifications | Mapped at two-digit w/ modifications |
| 2013 | NOIC unknown | ISIC Rev.4 | NOIC unknown | ISCO 08| Mapped at four-digit w/ modifications | Mapped at three-digit w/ modifications |
| 2021 | NOIC unknown | ISIC Rev.4 | NOIC unknown | ISCO 08| Mapped at four-digit w/ modifications | Mapped at three-digit w/ modifications |

*Note: The only NOIC version confirmed, NOIC 1994, was found in a document of another survey "[THE 2001 CHILD LABOUR SURVEY](utilities/isic_isco/Occupation%20LFS%201999%20%20(English).doc)". It is allegedly said that NOIC 1994 was based on ISIC 1994 in its annual report but we found that the ETH 1999 had almost half of its industry codes in the dataset unmatched to ISIC Rev.3. Therefore, eventhough we have information on industrial classification of ETH 1999 we did not harmonize this year.*

We listed all the modifications made in the following sections as they are not large in amount.
