## What is the ETH LFS?

The Ethiopian Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA). This survey was firstly undertaken in 1999 followed by LFS 2005 as the second one in the LFS series. Till the birth of LFS 1999, there has not been a comprehensive national labor force survey representing both urban and rural area in Ethiopia. Both the 1981/82 and 1987/88 surveys only covered the rural part of the country. Therefore, the LFS came out to cover both the urban and rural areas of all regions (except Gambella region, Affar Region, and Somali) in Ethiopia to fill the vancancy of national statistics.


## What does the ETH LFS cover?

The ETH LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days. In addition, the ETH LFS also includes information on migration. Year 2021 has richer content on disabilities section. Years used for harmonization range from 1999 to 2021 discontinuously, 4 years in total.

Years and sample size of LFS harmonized for GLD are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **Officially Reported Sample Size(# HH)**	| **Officially Reported Population (# Individuals)** |
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	| :-------:	|
| [1999](utilities/ETH_1999_LFS_report.pdf)  | 81,339        | 366,274      |  54,430,917  |   81,473   | 54,453,238|
| [2005](utilities/Labour_force_survey_Final_Report_2005.pdf)  | 54,443        | 230,680      |  63,228,599  |   54,484   | 63,228,600|
| [2013](utilities/nlfs_analytical_report labor_force_2013.pdf)  | 58,321        | 240,660      |  80,444,148  |   58,396   | 80,444,148|
| [2021](utilities/FINAL_STATISTICAL_REPORT_ON_THE_202_ LMS_(003).docx)  | 43,329        | 174,613      |  98,035,894 |    49,916   | 98,038,146|

All the four years' official annual reports are provided in the table above through the links attached to each year. The officially reported HH sample size all came from their annual reports. 

Note that the number of households in our harmonized datasets do not equal the number of sample size in each year's annual report. We commonly created HH identifiers using seven original variables: region, zone, wereda, town, kefetegna, Kebele, and enumeration area serial number according to their processing methodology. Even though the HH sample sizes do not match the reported size, the expanded population are quite close to their official estimates.     

## Where can the data be found?

The microdata of LFS from 2009 are publicly available on the official website of PBS through this [link](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/microdata). And accordingly, each year's report of 2007 to 2020 can be found through the [link here](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/all-reports-and-publications). Data prior to 2009 was shared internally with the World Bank.


## What is the sampling procedure?

LFS uses a two-stage cluster sampling method in general, which includes two steps: 1) selecting the primary sampling units (PSU), which are enumeration blocks in both urban and rural domains 2) selecting the secondary sampling units, which include listed households of sample PSUs. The first year of the GLD, 1992, is only nationally representative at urban/rural level; the last year of harmonization, 2020, is the only year that has district level of representativeness; and all years in between are representative at rural/urban level of the province.

More details of the sampling frame & procedure are included in each year's annual report. Here is an example of [LFS 2020](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/labour_force/publications/lfs2020_21/LFS_2020-21_Report.pdf) (page 19/20 of the PDF):

```
Universe: The universe for Labour Force Survey consists of all urban and rural areas of the four provinces of Pakistan and Islamabad excluding military restricted areas. The population of excluded areas constitutes about 1% of the total population.

A stratified two-stage sample design is adopted for the survey.

Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has developed its own sampling frame for both urban and rural domains. Each city/town is divided into enumeration blocks. Each enumeration block is comprised of 200 to 250 households on the average with well-defined boundaries and maps. The frame used in this survey was the most recent frame which is updated through Population and Housing Census 2017.

Rural Domain: Each administrative district in the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KP) is considered an independent stratum whereas in Balochistan, each administrative division constitutes a stratum.
Urban Domain: All administrative divisions in the four provinces, constitutes separate stratum.

Selection of primary sampling units (PSUs)
Enumeration blocks in both Urban and Rural domains are taken as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Sample PSUs from each ultimate stratum/sub-stratum are selected with probability proportional to size (PPS) method of sampling scheme. In both Urban and Rural domains, the number of households in an enumeration blocks considered as measure of size.

Selection of secondary sampling units (SSUs)
The listed households of sample PSUs are taken as Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). A specified number of households i.e. 12 from each urban sample PSU and 16 from rural sample PSU are selected with equal probability using systematic sampling technique with a random start.

## What is the geographic significance level?

****************
*** COMMENT ***
text above says 1992 is only national (urban rural) the table below says it is province. Please confirm which one it is.
Also: for 2005 onward at least it is province + urban / rural
****************

The official reports detailed results by gender, sector (i.e. urban or rural), and the four main provinces in Pakistan – Punjab, Sindh, the North-West Frontier Province(N.W.F.P.), and Balochistan. Among the raw datasets of all LFSs, 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2018 are the only four years that contain more than the four major provinces. The table below shows provinces included in each year and the geographic significance level.

| **Year**	| **Province Covered**	| **Historical Change**	|
| :------:	| :-------------------: | :-------------------:	|
| 1992  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 1999  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2001  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2003  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2005  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |

| 2008  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2009  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2010  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/AK,Kashmir/GB | The name of NWFP changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (or K/P province)|

| 2020  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan   | N/A |  


## Other noteworthy aspects


### Definition of Labor Status and Labor Force Participation

LFS has its own conception and definition documentation for variables. These documents can be found on the International Labour Organization data catalog [website](https://www.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog/?page=1&from=2000&to=2020&ps=15). When coding GLD variable `lstatus` and `potential_lf`, we need to adapt GLD definition for *being employed* and *unemployed* to fit LFS's own definition, and more often, this requires us to expand GLD definition.

Earlier years before 2012 are coded slightly differently from other years as they have less labor questions. A more comprehensive explanation of the harmonization choices [is covered here in a separate document](Labor_Status_and_Labor_Force_Participation.md).    


### Coding of industry and occupation codes

Regarding industrial classification, 3 versions of Pakistani Standard Industrial Classification (PSIC) were involved from 1992 to 2020 – PSIC 1970, 2007, 2010. They are based on different versions of ISIC and were used in different years of LFS. in the [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)

Although three versions of Pakistani Standard Occupational Codes (PSCO) were involved – PSCO 1994, 2011, and 2015, they are based on two versions of international standards which are ISCO 1988 AND 2008. PSCO 1994 follows ISCO 1988 whereas PSCO 2011 and 2015 follow ISCO 2008.

In general, each single version of national standards, regardless of industry or occupation, is almost identical to their international counterparts at two-digit level. Details about industrial and occuaptional mappings are covered in this [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)


### Helper files for district, migration country, and training field coding

We created several codelist for `subnatid2`, `migrated_from_code`, and `vocational_field_orig` according to PBS's coding scheme for each year. These files and their use can be found in the table below.
