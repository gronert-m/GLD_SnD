## What is the ETH LFS?

The Ethiopian Labor Force Survey (LFS) is a household-based sample survey conducted by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA). This survey was firstly undertaken in 1999 followed by LFS 2005 as the second one in the LFS series. Till the birth of LFS 1999, there has not been a comprehensive national labor force survey representing both urban and rural area in Ethiopia. Both the 1981/82 and 1987/88 surveys only covered the rural part of the country. Therefore, the LFS came out to cover both the urban and rural areas of all regions (except Gambella region, Affar Region, and Somali) in Ethiopia to fill the vancancy of national statistics.


## What does the ETH LFS cover?

The ETH LFS mainly covers detailed information on demographic details, including age, sex, marital status, and location, education, and labour market activities over the previous 7 days. In addition, the ETH LFS also includes information on migration. Year 2021 has richer content on disabilities section. Years used for harmonization range from 1999 to 2021 discontinuously, 4 years in total.

Years and sample size of LFS harmonized for GLD are:

| **Year**	| **# of Households**	| **# of Individuals**	| **Expanded Population**	| **Officially Reported Sample Size(# HH)**	| **Officially Reported Population (# Individuals)** |
| :------:	| :-------:		| :-------:	 	| :-------:	 	| :-------:	| :-------:	|
| [1999](utilities/ETH_1999_LFS_report.pdf)  | 81,339        | 366,274      |  54,430,917  |   81,473   | 54,453,238|
| [2005](utilities/Labour_force_survey_Final_Report_2005.pdf)  | 54,443        | 230,680      |  63,228,599  |   54,484   | 63,228,600|
| [2013](utilities/nlfs_analytical_report labor_force_2013.pdf)  | 58,321        | 240,660      |  80,444,148  |   58,396   | 80,444,148|
| [2021](utilities/FINAL_STATISTICAL_REPORT_ON_THE_2021_LMS.docx)  | 43,329        | 174,613      |  98,035,894 |    49,916   | 98,038,146|

All the four years' official annual reports are provided in the table above through the links attached to each year. The officially reported HH sample size all came from their annual reports. 

Note that the number of households in our harmonized datasets do not equal the number of sample size in each year's annual report. We commonly created HH identifiers using seven original variables: region, zone, wereda, town, kefetegna, Kebele, and enumeration area serial number according to their processing methodology. Even though the HH sample sizes do not match the reported size, the expanded population are quite close to their official estimates. It might be the case that the CSA has adjusted the weights in the raw datasets so as to match the population estimates.      


## Where can the data be found?

The microdata of ETH LFS are unfortunately not publicly available. All data are World Bank internal use only. 


## What is the sampling procedure?

The sampling procedure is a mixture of two-stage cluster and three-stage cluster sample design. Firstly, the whole country is divided into three broad categories: *rural*, *major urban centers*, and *other urban centers*. For category 1-rural and category 2-major urban areas, a stratified two-stage cluster sample design was used, which selects primary sampling units (PSU: enumeration areas) and secondary sampling units (SSU: households). But for other urban centers, a stratified three-stage cluster sample design was adopted. The PSUs are urban centers follwed by enumeration areas (EA) as SSUs and last but not least, households. For all four years. ETH LFS are representative at urban/rural parts of region level. 

More details of the sampling frame & procedure are included in each year's annual report. Here is an example of [LFS 2013](utilities/nlfs_analytical_report labor_force_2013.pdf) (page 19/20 of the PDF):

```
For the purpose of the survey the country was divided into three broad categories. That is; rural, major urban center and other urban center categories.
Category I: Rural: - This category consists of the rural areas of nine regions and one rural part of city administration found in the country. Regarding the survey domains, each region or city administration was considered to be a domain (Reporting Level) for which major findings of the survey are reported. This category totally comprises 10 reporting levels. A stratified two-stage cluster sample design was used to select samples in which the primary sampling units (PSUs) were EAs. Households per sample EA were selected as a second Stage Sampling Unit (SSSU) and the survey questionnaire finally administered to all members of sample households.

Category II:- Major urban centers:- In this category all regional capitals and 15 other major urban centers that had a population size of 100,000 or more in 2007 were included. Each urban center in this category was considered as a reporting level.

This category has totally 26 reporting levels. In this category too, in order to select the samples, a stratified two-stage cluster sample design was implemented. The primary sampling units were EAs. Households from each sample EA were then selected as a Second Stage Unit.

Category III: - Other urban centers: Urban centers in the country other than those under category II were grouped into this category. Harari, Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa do not have urban centers other than that grouped in category II. Hence, no domain was formed for these regions under this category.

Unlike the above two categories a stratified three stage cluster sample design was adopted to select samples from this category. The primary sampling units were urban centers, the second stage sampling units were EAs and Households from each EA were finely selected at the third stage and the survey questionnaires administered for all of them.

## What is the geographic significance level?

****************
*** COMMENT ***
text above says 1992 is only national (urban rural) the table below says it is province. Please confirm which one it is.
Also: for 2005 onward at least it is province + urban / rural
****************

The official reports detailed results by gender, sector (i.e. urban or rural), and the four main provinces in Pakistan – Punjab, Sindh, the North-West Frontier Province(N.W.F.P.), and Balochistan. Among the raw datasets of all LFSs, 2010, 2014, 2017, and 2018 are the only four years that contain more than the four major provinces. The table below shows provinces included in each year and the geographic significance level.

| **Year**	| **Province Covered**	| **Historical Change**	|
| :------:	| :-------------------: | :-------------------:	|
| 1992  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 1999  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2001  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2003  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2005  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2007  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2008  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2009  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2010  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/AK,Kashmir/GB | The name of NWFP changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (or K/P province)|  
| 2012  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |  
| 2013  | Punjab/Sindh/NWFP/Balochistan | N/A |
| 2014  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/Islamabad| N/A |

| 2018  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan/Islamabad| Federally Administered Tribal Areas, or "FATA" was merged into K/P|
| 2020  | Punjab/Sindh/KP/Balochistan   | N/A |  


## Other noteworthy aspects


### Definition of Labor Status and Labor Force Participation

LFS has its own conception and definition documentation for variables. These documents can be found on the International Labour Organization data catalog [website](https://www.ilo.org/surveyLib/index.php/catalog/?page=1&from=2000&to=2020&ps=15). When coding GLD variable `lstatus` and `potential_lf`, we need to adapt GLD definition for *being employed* and *unemployed* to fit LFS's own definition, and more often, this requires us to expand GLD definition.

Earlier years before 2012 are coded slightly differently from other years as they have less labor questions. A more comprehensive explanation of the harmonization choices [is covered here in a separate document](Labor_Status_and_Labor_Force_Participation.md).    


### Coding of industry and occupation codes

Regarding industrial classification, 3 versions of Pakistani Standard Industrial Classification (PSIC) were involved from 1992 to 2020 – PSIC 1970, 2007, 2010. They are based on different versions of ISIC and were used in different years of LFS. in the [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)

Although three versions of Pakistani Standard Occupational Codes (PSCO) were involved – PSCO 1994, 2011, and 2015, they are based on two versions of international standards which are ISCO 1988 AND 2008. PSCO 1994 follows ISCO 1988 whereas PSCO 2011 and 2015 follow ISCO 2008.

In general, each single version of national standards, regardless of industry or occupation, is almost identical to their international counterparts at two-digit level. Details about industrial and occuaptional mappings are covered in this [separate document.](Correspondence_National_International_Classifications.md)


### Helper files for district, migration country, and training field coding

We created several codelist for `subnatid2`, `migrated_from_code`, and `vocational_field_orig` according to PBS's coding scheme for each year. These files and their use can be found in the table below.
