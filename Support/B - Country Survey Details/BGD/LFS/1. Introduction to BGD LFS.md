# Introduction to Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (BGD LFS)

## What is the BGD LFS?

The Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS), initiated by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) in 1980, has been carried out at irregular intervals over the years. The GLD team has harmonized data for last LFS rounds, 2005-06, 2010, and 2013, before being replaced by the [Quarterly Labor Force Survey (QLFS)](../QLFS/Introduction%20to%20BGD%20QLFS.md) beginning 2015.

## What does the BGD LFS cover?

The Bangladesh LFS is a labor force survey with information on demographic characteristics, education, and labor market activities over the past 7 days. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:

| Year | HH count | Individual count |
|---|---|---|
| 2005 |          40,000  |                      188,487  |
| 2010 |          43,949  |                      199,274 |
| 2013 |          36,242  |                      156,987  |


## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are not accessible to the public and researchers have to request the data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to gld@worldbank.org

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Labor Force Survey (LFS) in Bangladesh employs a two-stage stratified sampling design to gather representative data on the country's labor force. This sampling methodology involves selecting Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) in the first stage and households within each PSU in the second stage. Both stages employ random selection techniques, ensuring the sample's representativeness. 

In 2010, the LFS updated its frame to improve the quality and reliability of the estimates. Before then, the LFS utilized the Integrated Multipurpose Sample (IMPS) design, which consisted of 1,000 PSUs covering both rural and urban areas. However, as the IMPS areas became outdated, the LFS transitioned to an updated Master Sampling Frame in 2010. This new design was based on the 2001 Population Census enumeration areas and expanded the number of PSUs to 1,500, increasing the number of surveyed households.


## What is the significance level?

The official reports detail estimates by area of residence (urban or rural), and the first level administrative units, called *divisions* in Bangladesh. 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Household ID

The datasets received do not contain ID information. In the GLD project, we have created IDs to provide the best user experience based on geographic identifiers. The household ID is formed based on information on the primary sampling unit and the household identification number. 

### Geographic Information

As of the time of writing (April 2023) Bangladesh is composed of eight administrative divisions: Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Barisal, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur, and Mymensingh (see figure below).

The table below shows the divisions as of writing and what divisions they belonged to at the earliest survey (currently 2005)

| Divisions as of april 2023    | Divisions in 2005             |
|:-----------------------------:|:------------------------------|
| Barisal                       | Barisal                       |
| Chittagong                    | Chittagong                    |
| Dhaka                         | Dhaka                         |
| Khulna                        | Khulna                        |
| Mymenshingh                   | Dhaka                         |
| Rajshahi                      | Rajshahi                      |
| Rangpur                       | Rajshahi                      |
| Sylhet                        | Sylhet                        |

The division of Rangpur was created in 2010, splitting off Rajshahi, and consists of the districts of Dinajpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, Rangpur, and Thakurgaon.

The division of Mymensingh was created in 2015, splitting off Dhaka, and consists of the districts of Jamalpur. Mymensingh, Netrokona, and Sherpur.

### Employment: Industry Classification

The Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS) employs its national industry classification system called the Bangladesh Standards for Industrial Classification (BSIC), which is adapted from the International Standards for Industrial Classification (ISIC).

| Year | Classification in survey | ISIC revision mapped to | How mapped                |
|:----:|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------|
| 2005 | BSIC 2001                | ISIC revision 3         | With correspondence table |
| 2010 | BSIC 2009                | ISIC revision 4         | First two digits          |
| 2013 | Unknown                  | ISIC revision 4         | First two digits          |

For 2005, the correspondence is done at four digits based on [a PDF table](Utilities/BSIC_code.pdf), which we converted into a `.dta` file that is read in the harmonization process. The [file is available here](Utilities/Additional%20Data/bsic_isic_mapping.dta).


In 2010, industries were categorized using the BSIC 2009 classification system. This system is largely compatible with ISIC Revision 4 at the 2-digit level, with one notable exception: code "34" (Recycling) is differentiated from code "38". In ISIC, code "38" encompasses recycling activities as well.

In the case of 2013, the actual version is unknown, but a manual review of the codes agrees with the fact the coding is based on ISIC revision #. However, since the full correspondence is unknown, only the first two two digits are mapped to.

### Employment: Occupation Classification

| Year | Classification in survey | ISCO revision mapped to | How mapped                |
|:----:|:------------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------|
| 2005 | ISCO 1988                | ISCO 1988               | First two digits          |
| 2010 | ISCO 1988                | ISCO 1988               | First four digits; if not in ISCO, mapped to first two or three digits         |
| 2013 | BSCO 2012                | ISCO 2008               | First two digits; if not in ISCO, mapped to the first digit         |

The Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS) utilizes two different occupational classifications to identify respondents' occupations. According to survey documentation, the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) was used in the 2005 and 2010 rounds, while the Bangladesh Standard of Occupational Classification (BSOC) 2012 was used in the 2013, 2015, and 2016 rounds.

Although the survey documentation states that the occupational codes used in the 2005 and 2010 rounds were equivalent to ISCO 1988, some four-digit occupational codes could not be found within the ISCO 1988 list at the same level. Also, we do not possess a correspondence table to map the BSOC 2012 codes to the ISCO 2008 codes. Given the issues mentioned, we recourse to using the two-digit LFS occupational codes to identify the corresponding ISCO codes while continue our efforts to gather more resources for a precise mapping of occupational codes with ISCO.

### Wages

Information on wages are collected based on different reference time periods. In 2010 and 2013, previous month wages were asked. Meanwhile, in 2005, the reference period for wages are distinguished between day laborers and wage workers. Day laborers' wages were reported on a weekly basis, while salaried workers' wages were reported on a monthly basis. This information was not provided in the questionnaire, but the reported wage data in the [2005 survey report](Utilities/Labour%20Force%20Survey-2005-6.PDF) were replicated using this distinction. Note that the estimates for the "<1000" category can only be replicated if all wage workers with missing wages are assumed to fall under this income category.

### Employment Status

The employment status categories in the Bangladesh LFS vary over the years. The precise details on coding the `empstat` variable is covered in a separate document [here](Employment%20status.md).
