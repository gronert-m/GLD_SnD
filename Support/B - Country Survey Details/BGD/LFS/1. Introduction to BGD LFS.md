# Introduction to Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (BGD LFS)

## What is the BGD LFS?

The Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS), initiated by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) in 1980, has been carried out at irregular intervals over the years. The GLD team has harmonized data for the five most recent rounds: 2005-06, 2010, 2013, 2015-16, and 2016-17. In the latest two rounds (2015-16 and 2016-17), the surveys were renamed as the Quarterly Labor Force Survey (QLFS), providing data on a quarterly basis to offer a more detailed understanding of labor market dynamics. Additionally, the questionnaire was updated to gather information on the own-use production of goods and services, a crucial aspect of the informal labor market and subsistence activities in Bangladesh.

## What does the BGD LFS cover?

The Bangladesh LFS is a labor force survey with information on demographic characteristics, education, and labor market activities over the past 7 days. The harmonized years and sample sizes used in the GLD harmonization are as follows:
| Year | HH count | Individual count |
|---|---|---|
| 2005 |          40,000  |                      188,487  |
| 2010 |          43,949  |                      199,274 |
| 2013 |          36,242  |                      156,987  |
| 2015-16 |          121,082  |                      503,756  |
| 2016-17 |          122,455|                      493,886  |

During the 2015-16 and 2016-17 rounds, the Bangladesh LFS implemented a rotational sampling design, in which individuals were interviewed for two consecutive quarters before being replaced. For these two rounds, the table above presents household and individual frequency data distinctively for each quarter.

## Where can the data be found?

The datasets are not accessible to the public and researchers have to request the data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The World Bank has been granted access to the datasets, if you work or are part of the World Bank Group, kindly contact the Jobs Group with a formal request for access to gld@worldbank.org

## What is the sampling procedure?

The Labor Force Survey (LFS) in Bangladesh employs a two-stage stratified sampling design to gather representative data on the country's labor force. This sampling methodology involves selecting Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) in the first stage and households within each PSU in the second stage. Both stages employ random selection techniques, ensuring the sample's representativeness. In the 2015-16 and 2016-17 rounds, the LFS implemented a rotational panel strategy, where some households in each cluster were replaced by new ones every two quarters.

In 2010, the LFS updated its frame to improve the quality and reliability of the estimates. Before then, the LFS utilized the Integrated Multipurpose Sample (IMPS) design, which consisted of 1,000 PSUs covering both rural and urban areas. However, as the IMPS areas became outdated, the LFS transitioned to an updated Master Sampling Frame in 2010. This new design was based on the 2001 Population Census enumeration areas and expanded the number of PSUs to 1,500, increasing the number of surveyed households.


## What is the significance level?

The official reports detail estimates by area of residence (urban or rural), and division. 

## Other noteworthy aspects

### Household ID

The datasets received do not contain ID information. In the GLD project, we have created IDs to provide the best user experience based on geographic identifiers. The household ID is formed based on information on the primary sampling unit and the household identification number. 

### Geographic Information

Bangladesh is composed of eight administrative divisions: Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Barisal, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur, and Mymensingh. The LFS series has not yet incorporated Mymensingh, which was established in 2015, even though it was already a separate division during the last two rounds. In the 2013 LFS, Rangpur was included as an independent division following its creation in 2010. This division comprises eight districts that were previously under Rajshahi's jurisdiction: Rangpur, Dinajpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Panchagarh, and Thakurgaon.


### Migration

Questions relating to migration were asked only until 2000. Information was available on individualâ€™s previous area and province of residence, and reason for migration. However, the questions were only asked in the first and third rounds of the surveys. 

### Employment: Industry Classification
The Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS) employs its national industry classification system called the Bangladesh Standards for Industrial Classification (BSIC), which is adapted from the International Standards for Industrial Classification (ISIC).

BSIC and ISIC classifications are comparable at the two-digit level. Over the years, the BSIC has been updated, resulting in different versions being used throughout the LFS. For instance, the 2005 LFS utilizes the BSIC 2001, which is comparable to ISIC version 3, while all subsequent rounds employ the BSIC 2009, which is in line with ISIC version 4.

A [correspondence table](Utilities/BSIC_code.pdf) is available for mapping BSIC 2001 codes to ISIC version 3 codes at the four-digit level. However, the team is currently gathering reference materials to determine how to map the BSIC 2009 to ISIC version 4 at the four-digit level. In the meantime, two-digit BSIC codes are used to identify the corresponding ISIC version 4 codes.

### Employment: Occupation Classification
The Bangladesh Labor Force Survey (LFS) utilizes various occupational classifications to identify respondents' occupations. According to survey documentation, the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) was applied in the 2005 and 2010 rounds, while the Bangladesh Standard of Occupational Classification (BSOC) 2012 was employed in the 2013, 2015, and 2016 rounds.

Although the survey documentation states that the occupational codes used in the 2005 and 2010 rounds were equivalent to ISCO 1988, some four-digit occupational codes could not be found within the ISCO 1988 list at the same level. Also, we do not possess a correspondence table to map the BSOC 2012 codes to the ISCO 2008 codes. Given the issues mentioned, we recourse to using the two-digit LFS occupational codes to identify the corresponding ISCO codes while continue our efforts to gather more resources for a precise mapping of occupational codes with ISCO.
