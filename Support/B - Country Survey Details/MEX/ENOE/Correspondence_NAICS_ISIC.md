# Correspondence between NAICS Mexico and ISIC

Information regarding the industry respondents are employed in is coded in the Encuesta Nacional de Ocupaci√≥n y Empleo (ENOE) using the codes of the [North American Industry Classification System](http://en.www.inegi.org.mx/app/scian/) (shortened as NAICS in English and SCIAN in Spanish). 

This document first describes the logic of the process and then provides users with the underlying conversions tables, conversion algorithms, as well as the generated `dta` files used in the harmonization codes.

## Data as present in survey raw data

The image below shows the answers to the relevant question (`p4a1` asks for the industry the company the respondent works for is in) for the dataset from the first quarter of 2010:

<br></br>

<br></br>

There are two things to note here. The first is that the information is at the four digit level (length of `p4a` is always 4), while NAICS is structured as a 6 digit system. Secondly, in some cases the information is only at the three-digit level. This is when the last digit is a zero (see higlighted cases above). The questionnaire allows respondents to describe their industry and this description is later converted into a code by the enumerators. If the information is insufficient to make a four-digit classification a higher level classification is done and the three-digit coded is padded with a zero so that all answers hace the same length. Note finally that the shown 14 codes cover 50% of all answers.

## Correspondance information available

The Mexican Statistics Institute INEGI has [website dedicated to NAICS](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/scian/) where it stores general information in the classificaiton and - most importantly for concordance purposes -  comparative tables between the different NAICS versions and the different ISCO versions. The image below shows the available comparisons in July 2021:

<br></br>

Of importance for the years covered by GLD (2005 to 2020) are the four classifications highlighted. Of the four, the latter three are mapped to ISIC Revision 4 while the earliest (NAICS 2002) is mapped to ISIC Revision 3.1.

The information is available as both a PDF and an Excel File. The image below shows the first lines of the first sheet of the 2007 to ISIC 4 Excel document:

<br></br>
![SCIAN Excel example](utilities/scian_07_example_xlsx.PNG)
<br></br>

Note how the first sheet contains the NAICS to ISIC mapping, while the second sheet maps the inverse relation. Note further that NAICS codes are all at 6 digit level in the comparison tables provided by the National Statistics Office (NSO) while the ISIC code is just at 4 digits.

The last piece of information to understand before proceeding with creating a mapping `.dta` that can be used in the harmonization is the fact that mapping is not perfect in the correspondence tables provided by the NSO. In the above image this is the case (e.g., 111121 maps to 0111) but this is not always so. The image below shows how NAICS code 111410 maps to five (!) different and distinct ISIC codes.

## Creating a map between NAICS and ISIC

### Overall mapping logic

The overall mapping is done in two steps. The first step is to create an `R` code that reads in the Excel file from the NSO, cleans it (note in the image how there are empty lines between two NAICS codes) and equates four-digit NAICS codes (since information in ENOE is at four-digits, as shown at the top) to an ISIC code. The code generates a `.dta` file that lists all possible unique NAICS codes and provides the corresponding ISIC code.

The second step is to use the `.dta` created in the first step in the harmonization. That is to merge in the correspondance table when harmonizing and use matched ISIC codes to generate the GLD `industrycat_isic` variable.

### Generating the `R` code and resulting `.dta` file

The mapping of NAICS to ISIC codes is performed by a user written `R` code. It reads from the relevant NSO correpsondence Excel file (NAICS 2002, 2007, 2013, and 2018) stored under `MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE\MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE_v01_M\Doc` and writes the comparison `.dta` file merged in the harmonization under `MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE\MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE_v01_M\Data\Stata`. The corresponding `R` itself is stored under `MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE\MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE_v01_M\Programs`. Note that the actual files are stored on a World Bank server - this repository only tracks code files.

The first step in the process is to reduce the NSO correspondece six-digit system to the four digits covered in the ENOE. This creates duplicates as there are 17 codes between `111110` and `111199` for NAICS-07 that are reduced to `1111`. (The examples in this explainer are based on the NAICS-07 to ISIC 4 conversion as well as the ENOE 2010 data, the logic however holds for all correspondences).

The second step is to compare the correspondence of NAICS four-digit codes to ISIC four-digit codes, and count the number of total cases and the number of matches to each code. The image below shows this process for some of the first codes:

<br></br>
![SCIAN Reducation Logic](utilities/scian_07_2010_match_1.PNG)
<br></br>

The table shows  that of the 16 codes that start with `1111` all of them match to ISIC code `0111`, while one matches to `0112`. The 9 NAICS codes that start with `1112` match to three different ISIC four digit codes. However, further down, codes starting with `1121` and `1122` all match to one specific four-digit ISIC code - perfect matches.At this stage, only perfect matches are kept. All other matches (i.e., those like `1111` and `1112`) are sent to the third step.

The third step matches each four-digit NAICS code at the three-digit level to the three digit ISIC equivalent. This is exemplified in the snapshot below:

<br></br>
![SCIAN Reducation Logic](utilities/scian_match_2_df_example.PNG)
<br></br>

At this level, all 17 NAICS codes starting with `1111` map to an ISIC code starting with `011` (i.e., `pct` value is 100). Now we have a perfect match for it as well. For NAICS codes starting with `1112` there is no such perfect match. 8 out of 9 map to ISIC codes starting with `011` but one maps to `0112`. Again we only keep perfect matches. Also, the next step may seem already clear, that is, to map the four-digit NAICS code to ISIC two-digit codes. It is clear from the above image that this will yield a perfect match for `1112` as both start with `01`.

Hence, the fourth step comparres NAICS four-digit to ISIC two-digit. The image below shows what was said, codes starting with `1112` can be mapped perfectly to ISIC `01`. 

<br></br>
![SCIAN Reducation Logic](utilities/scian_match_3_df_example.PNG)
<br></br>

The difference at this point is that two digits is the lowest classification we can do for ISIC. Hence we cannot just keep perfect matches. At this stage, the most common match is kept. Looking at the image above this means that for NAICS codes starting with `1114` these will be mapped to ISIC code `01`. The most difficult cases are when there are ties, as is the case for NAICS codes starting with `1133` or `2221`. In these cases one two digit ISIC code is chosen at random. A seed is set in the code to ensure that the randomisation always picks the same code.

Recalling the tabulation shown at the top of this explainer, even though the ENOE information is always of length four, it is not always a four-digit code (e.g., the most common code is `1110`.) Since none of the four-digit codes end on `0`, this means we additionally need to create a classification for the NAICS three-digit codes. This is done in much the same ways as was done for the four digit codes.

After reducing all six-digit codes to three-digit codes, the comparison is made to the ISIC three-digit codes.  The image below shows the comparison where we see that codes starting with `111` map mostly to `011` and `012` but not to one uniquely. As previously only perfect matches are kept.

<br></br>
![SCIAN Reducation Logic](utilities/scian_match_d_df_example.PNG)
<br></br>

Of the not perfect matches (as was the case for `111`) these are mapped to ISIC two-digit codes. As this is the smallest unit, as with NAICS four-digit codes now we map to the most common group. The image below shows this process:

<br></br>
![SCIAN Reducation Logic](utilities/scian_match_d2_df_example.PNG)
<br></br>

NAICS codes starting with `111` do not map perfectly but nearly all of the codes that start by it map to ISIC `01`. In this case, chosing the most common class is a good choice. For codes starting with `222`, however, this is more difficult. Here, again, the choice is made at random.

The final stage is to put together all different matches into a single data frame, pad zeroes to make sure both NAICS and ISIC codes are of lenght four, and export it as a `.dta` file (into `MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE\MEX_[YYYY]_ENOE_v01_M\Data\Stata`) to be merged. The final `.dta` file looks like this:

<br></br>

### Merging the correspondence with the survey data

The data is merged in the harmonization at the first stage of database assembly (see individual harmonization codes). In the case of the 2010 ENOE there are 166,283 individuals for which the survey has an industry NAICS code. The correspondence process is able to match to 160,698 of those (96.6%). The image below shows the quality of the matches made:

<br></br>
![SCIAN Reducation Logic](utilities/matching_outcome.png)
<br></br>

The histogram on the left hand side shows that about three quarters of the observations are to perfect or nearly perfect matches (recall the match of `111` to `01` earlier) and nearly all are above 60%. However, there are a few worse matches. The right hand side shows the tabulation result in Stata. Recall that Stata will order observations alphanumerically (i.e., it starts with 25, the worst match, here and goes down to 100). That means that only 6.09% of observations have a match of 60% or worse. Nearly two thirds have a perfect match, while 85% of observations have a match of 66.7%.

## Caveats and extensions

### Caveat - What the mapping does and does not do

Overall, the quality of the mapping seems to be very good. However, the metric used to evaluate matching quality, while sensible, contains potential pitfalls. The most obvious one is that it is evaluating importance of a map by number of existing codes and not relevance of the codes. As an example, see the following excerpt from NAICS:

| NAICS Code    | NAICS Description                 | ISIC Code |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------: | --------: |
| 312131        | Grape alcoholic drinks            | 1101      |
| 312132        | Pulque (fermented agave)          | 1102      |
| 312139        | Cider & other fermented drinks    | 1102      |
| 312141        | Rum & sugar cane drinks           | 1101      |
| 312142        | Distilled agave drinks            | 1101      |


The way the correspondence has proceeded, it treats every entry equally. However, given that tequila, probably the economically most important drink in Mexico is made from agave, NAICS code `312142` should be weighted more strongly in this context. If we think of Cuba, code `312141` should probably be more important. This information, however, is not avaialable to us. Furthermore, note that the process of matching less than perfectly at only the lowest level of ISIC solves the issue here. All these NAICS codes starting with `3121` don't match to ISIC at four digits but do so perfectly to `110`. 

In this case no problem has arisen and as small niches grow, they can be expected to obtain more codes (as clothing grows, groups are created for shirts, trousers, ...) so it can be assumed that a single category is not significantly larger than any other category in the economy, but it still should be kept in mind that the evaluation of the mapping is based only on the number of categories, regardless of the economic relevance.

### Extension - What you may add if you would be available

A further extension, which may help in creating better matches is to use the text descriptions, provided in the NSO correspondence document, which define in more detail what the NAICS and ISIC codes cover. This is beyond our current capacity, though. If you, dear Reader, think you may be able to support this, please contact the team here on GitHub. We really would appreciate any help!

## Underlying data for emulating process
The harmonization codes merge in `dta` files created from the correspondence tables shown above using the algorithmic logic described in this document. In particular we use:

- [The correspondence table between SCIAN 02 and ISIC 3.1](utilities/SCIAN_02_ISIC_3.1.xlsx);
- [The correspondence table between SCIAN 07 and ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_07_ISIC_4.xlsx);
- [The correspondence table between SCIAN 13 and ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_13_ISIC_4.xlsx);
- [The correspondence table between SCIAN 18 and ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_18_ISIC_4.xlsx).

Each of these correspondence tables are read in by each of the analogous `R` codes:
- [The `R` code to map SCIAN 03 to ISIC 3.1](utilities/SCIAN_02_ISIC_3.1.R);
- [The `R` code to map SCIAN 07 to ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_07_ISIC_4.R);
- [The `R` code to map SCIAN 13 to ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_13_ISIC_4.R);
- [The `R` code to map SCIAN 18 to ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_18_ISIC_4.R).

These create then the used `dta` files:
- [The `dta` file with codes for SCIAN 03 and ISIC 3.1](utilities/SCIAN_02_ISIC_3.1.dta);
- [The `dta` file with codes for SCIAN 03 and ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_07_ISIC_4.dta);
- [The `dta` file with codes for SCIAN 03 and ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_13_ISIC_4.dta);
- [The `dta` file with codes for SCIAN 03 and ISIC 4](utilities/SCIAN_18_ISIC_4.dta).
